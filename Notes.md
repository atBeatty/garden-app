User stories -
    The user can add plants to their garden collection.
    The user can receive information on how to care for them.
    The user is met with a homepage with a did you know section about plant care.

Data - The attributes for the plant class are indexed, and linked to option buttons and dropdown lists

MVP - The garden app should let the user manage a collection of their plants and receive information back on how to care for them via a schedule of sorts.

GROWING MIX FOR FLOWERING HOUSE PLANTS
The following potting mix will grow acceptable flowering plants in most homes for most gardeners:

1 part garden loam or potting soil
1 part sand or perlite or vermiculite
1 part peat moss
Add 2 to 3 ounces of 20 percent superphosphate and ¾ ounce of either bonemeal or dolomitic limestone (by weight) to 4 gallons of potting mix. After sterilizing the soil (see “How to Sterilize Soil”), add 3 tablespoons of a 6-6-6 or similarly balanced fertilizer to every 4 gallons (½ bushel) of mix. Add a minor element formulation according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

GROWING MIXES FOR FOLIAGE PLANTS
Although most foliage plants will grow satisfactorily in the growing mix recommended for flowering house plants, they will grow better if the mix contains a higher percentage of organic matter.

1 part garden loam or potting soil
1 part sand or 2 parts peat moss
OR

1 part pine bark
2 parts peatmoss
OR

1 part sand
1 part pine bark
1 part peat moss
Add 2 to 3 ounces (dry weight) of dolomitic limestone to 4 gallons (½ bushel) of mix. For fluoride-sensitive plants, adjust the pH so it is no lower than pH 6.5. Superphosphate contains enough fluoride to cause foliar burn on sensitive plants. After sterilizing the soil, add 3 tablespoons of a 6-6-6 or another fertilizer such as 5-10-5 to each ½ bushel. Plastic-coated fertilizers also can be used; most of them require about 2 ounces per ½ bushel. Add a minor element formulation to the potting mix per the manufacturer’s recommendation.

GROWING MIXES FOR BROMELIADS
Bromeliads are plants from Central and South America, which are either epiphytic (they grow on tree branches or in the crotches of trees) or terrestrial (they grow in the ground). Although most of the bromeliads can be grown successfully in foliage plant mixes, most grow better in specially designed soil mixes. Any mix for bromeliads must be well aerated and drained.

2 parts peat moss
1 part perlite
1 part fir bark
OR

1 part peat
1 part pine bark
OR

1 part peat
1 part pine bark
1 part cypress shavings
Add 2 ounces of dolomitic limestone to 4 gallons (½ bushel) of soil mix and a minor element mix. Dissolve 1 ounce of 10-10-10 water-soluble fertilizer in 3 gallons of water. Use this solution after repotting and again monthly when watering. Also, add enough water to fill the vase formed by the overlapping leaf bases.

GROWING MIXES FOR ORCHIDS
Orchids have a great deal in common with bromeliads because they also grow on trees as epiphytes and on the ground as terrestrials. A mix for orchids should have excellent drainage and aeration, too. Some soil mixes that can be used are:

3 parts osmunda tree fern fiber (moisten before use by soaking in water for 12 hours)
1 part redwood bark
OR

5 parts fir bark
1 part perlite
Tree fern slabs may also be used to grow epiphytic orchids.Add 1 ounce (dry weight) of dolomitic limestone per 4 gallons (½ bushel) of soil mix. Do not add fertilizer to the mix. After the plants are potted, add ¼ ounce of liquid 10-10-10 with minor elements per gallon of water and fertilize once every 6 weeks (if the plants are growing in osmunda fern fibers). If plants are growing in fir bark, use a liquid 30-10-10 with minor elements every 6 weeks instead of a 10-10-10 fertilizer.

GROWING MIX FOR SUCCULENTS AND CACTI
Cacti and other succulents grow best in a well-drained and aerated soil.

2 parts garden loam or potting soil
2 parts sand
2 parts peat
1 part perlite (crushed charcoal can be substituted)
Add 2 ounces (dry weight) of dolomitic limestone to 4 gallons (½ bushel) of soil mix, 2 ounces (by weight) of bonemeal, and ½ ounce of superphosphate. After sterilizing the soil, add a minor element supplement according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.

GROWING MIX FOR FERNS
Ferns grow well in most recommended mixes that have a high proportion of organic matter with good soil aeration and drainage characteristics. Use any of the suggested foliage plant mixes. However, most ferns kept indoors grow better in the following mix:

1 part garden loam or potting soil
1 part peat moss
1 part pine bark
1 part coarse sand
Add 2 ounces (dry weight) of dolomitic limestone to each ½ bushel (4 gallons) of soil mix and ½ ounce of either bonemeal or 20 percent superphosphate. After pasteurizing the soil mix, add minor elements to the mix. Add 1 tablespoon of a 6-6-6 or similarly balanced fertilizer to each ½ bushel of soil mix.

GROWING MIX FOR AFRICAN VIOLETS
Any number of soil mixes for African violets exist, and most of them will grow high quality plants. A good mix should be well drained and aerated.

2 parts peat moss
1 part vermiculite
1 part perlite
Add 2½ tablespoons of dolomite and 1½ tablespoons of 20 percent superphosphate to each ½ bushel of soil mix. Add 3 tablespoons of a high phosphorous fertilizer such as 5-10-5 or a similar ratio of fertilizer.
